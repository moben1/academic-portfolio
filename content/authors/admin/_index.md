Hey there! I'm Mohammed (Momo), a recent grad from the University of Sherbrooke passionate about leveraging AI/ML to
make healthcare more impactful and meaningful.

My journey has taken me from the competitive world of swimming to exploring the depths of ML. I'm not just about tech;
I'm also deeply into sports, having transitioned from swimming to triathlon, and I'm currently training for an Ironman!
Because, why not challenge myself even more?

This website is my digital playground. Here, you'll find a mix of everything that defines me: from my CV and portfolio
showcasing my coolest projects to hackathons and personal travel photos to show the world through my eyes. Expect to see
notes on intriguing papers, must-watch videos, helpful GitHub repos, and the tech stack I'm currently geeking out over
as I will be documenting my learning journey. It's a glimpse into my world of tech, sports, and making a difference with
AI. Stay tuned!
